# My First Blog Post

Published on: 2025-06-03

Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website.

## What I've accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: Installed Node.js and Git, created a new Astro project, and connected VS Code to GitHub.

2. **Making Pages**: Learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages` folder.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my 1st blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

## What's next

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.
